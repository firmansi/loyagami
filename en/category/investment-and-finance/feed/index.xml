		<p>Governments across the world in progressive locations from Singapore to Helsinki and Zurich, are also now developing ambitious smart city initiatives to hit their own mid-century targets, as called for by The Paris Agreement. Designated city zones known as Smart Quarters are being developed, and entire smart cities that are truly sustainable are being envisioned, with intelligent buildings, cleaner transportation and infrastructures that serve essential human needs such as security, comfort and connectivity.</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of next-generation technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), personalised healthcare and sustainable energy generation are also key drivers of the smart cities’ future. Furthermore, with cities and their buildings currently accounting for 65% of global energy demand, it is evident that the buildings we construct today are crucial for the evolution of smart cities and our push towards net-zero targets.</p>

	<div class="wpb_wrapper">
		<p>Intelligent buildings are a vital element to a future where cities become safe, smart and sustainable and building owners can harness and control their own energy usage.</p>
<p>Smart building technology has already helped many thousands of buildings and homes consume energy more efficiently. ABB has supported the construction of the New Development Bank (NDB) Headquarters in Shanghai by installing an intelligent and integrated building controls system, to manage indoor lighting, electric curtains and windows that involve more than 8,000 control circuits. Following the installation, the NBD Headquarters was able to make energy savings of more than 15% compared to conventional systems.</p>
<p>2021 marks a turning point in our collective ability to bring down emissions in our cities, save energy, and speed up the transition to renewable energy with smart buildings and power grids though the convergence of AI and IoT.</p>
<p>As emerging technologies continue to develop, more opportunities arise for buildings to leverage new technological processes and data sources. The concept of using technology to improve our cities and buildings is not a new one, but what <em>is</em> different is that IoT is now enabling us to connect an increasing number of devices which were not connected before. Connectivity really is the key to unleashing the true potential of intelligent buildings, unlocking opportunities for new information from infinite sources to be analyzed and combined, offering a new level of intelligence.</p>
<p>However, it is not just about using new technologies; smart thinking and the optimisation of existing buildings is a key factor when it comes to accelerating the sustainable development of smart cities globally. ABB is working closely with cities and utilities to obtain greater efficiencies from existing infrastructure and build unified, attractive city services as part of a move towards smarter cities. With IoT technologies, older buildings can take full advantage of the data they generate and adjust to how they operate.</p>
<p>One city doing just that is Zaragoza, the capital of Aragon, Spain. The city sought to reduce its total energy consumption by 20% with a focus on four major Zaragoza smart city buildings: the historical Seminario of Zaragoza, which houses City Hall offices, the main City Hall, the main police station and the Technology &amp; Art Center. Advanced energy monitoring was provided through a cloud-based energy management platform to bring the four buildings into compliance with the ISO 50001 standard. As a consequence, Zaragoza was able to fulfill the first steps on its way to compliance, and the collaboration resulted in savings of up to 30% in operational costs.</p>
<p>Another great example of smart city technology in action can be found in Hanoi, Vietnam. As part of the project, Vietnamese multinational telecommunication service, Viettel Group, is targetting to achieve their green objectives. Viettel wanted their headquarters in Hanoi to be a symbol of innovation and to set the standard for the rest of their buildings around the world. In order to meet the high demand for safe, smart and connected workplaces, a range of smart building technology has been supplied. Key to the project was the <em>i-bus KNX system</em>, with all devices of the building ranging from lighting and shutter control to heating, ventilation, security and energy management communicating with one and another via a single bus interface.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Financing:</strong> Upgrading a building may seem like a costly expense, however the advancements in IoT mean this is no longer the case.  Modern sensors can be connected wirelessly, without the need for expensive installation costs. The reduced energy and maintenance costs allow for a quick return on investment, with figures showing that intelligent buildings use 20-40% less energy and result in 8 – 9% lower operating expenses than those with older systems.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintenance: </strong>Predictive fault-finding can save maintenance time and labor, as well as minimising downtime for expensive equipment or services. Some estimates suggest that smart-enabled predictive maintenance is three to nine times cheaper than a traditional reactive approach. Tenant and occupant satisfaction are often also higher as systems that experience failure can be identified, repaired and re-booted quickly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design: </strong>Older buildings may not have been designed with smart technology in mind, but the latest technology is usually compact and lightweight, from IP entry systems to light switches through to energy management systems, making them easy to fit even the hardest to reach places. Wireless sensors are discreet and have an adhesive backing which can simply be stuck to walls, desks or ceilings with no screwing or external fixings required. Thick walls, which can sometimes obscure wi-fi signals, can be overcome with the use of ‘repeaters’ or signal-boosters, which help to extend the range of the products.</li>

		<p>Developing a holistic ecosystem where everything is connected and interoperable should be the key aim when it comes to smart city buildings now and in the future, from safety and security to comfort and control. Linking all elements of the smart building together into one easy-to-use system, that ultimately drives energy efficiency and reduces operating costs, from door entry to emergency lighting to harnessing the power of the sun through solar and integrating this with E-mobility solutions, such as EV charging.</p>
<p>A combination of solar power, smart energy management and a highly efficient cogeneration plant have proven to deliver enough energy to power a whole factory and save huge amounts of CO2 at ABB’s Busch-Jaeger subsidiary in Lüdenscheid. The carbon neutral factory generated 1,100 MWh in its first year, which was enough climate-neutral power to cover 100% of the factory’s power requirements on sunny days. It has also reduced the site’s CO2e emissions by some 680 tons per year.</p>

		<p>There is something that seems common to many Indonesians &#8211; namely, the joy of owning property. Of course, this is made more difficult because most of us want to live near the business area (CBD) of a big city, near the beach, or close to other great amenities that make work and non-work life enjoyable.</p>
<p>One of the perhaps slightly positive impacts of the Coronavirus tragedy is the trend of working from home, which is sure to see more company leaders encourage their staff to work productively from home.</p>
<p>This will increase the demand for property in the outer suburbs that may be one to two hours from a major city or business and work center.</p>
<p>At this time of the pandemic, many CBD apartments that were once easy to rent out for tourists or foreign workers and students have become difficult to rent for the long term and some investors / property owners have even decided to sell them. This means that some apartments that may have been too expensive for young people to buy in the days before the pandemic are now more affordable, especially if they are bought for rent.</p>
<p>Many first-time homebuyers, unable to buy property in the city where they want to live, can actually buy a house and rent it out until they can afford to live on the property they purchased. By doing so, you can benefit from the tax deductions that make the buy-for-rent deal successful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you really understand how the investment works and structure? This includes the tax benefits and how you’ll make the payments.</li>
<li>What is the business case for the investment? Would the average person buy this property? Do you know what it will actually cost you? How much will you make if you keep the investment for five or 10 years?</li>
<li>Does it commercially make sense? Is this the best use of your money? Could you buy cheaper, better and with more potential capital gain?</li>
<li>What could go wrong? Are you able to pivot if interest rates change or a tenant doesn’t pay your rent, etc?</li>
<li>Can you easily obtain the due diligence on the investment and people engaged in it? Do you have the lawyers/experts to make sure you don’t buy into a bad investment? Remember those who bought into apartments with cracks in the walls and fire-threatening panelling!</li>
<li>Will my investment withstand an unexpected economic shock or event? How would your investment deal with another pandemic?</li>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The residential market for the elderly is an opportunity and opportunities that can be glimpsed by developers in the country.</p></blockquote>



<p>In 2025 the number of elderly people (elderly) is estimated to have reached 20% of the total population of Indonesia. In fact, according to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) in 2014 the number of elderly people in Indonesia reached 20.24 million people, or the equivalent of 8.03 percent of the total population in that year.</p>



<p>Still from this data, it is stated that around 42.32 percent of the elderly live together with three generations in one household. As many as 26.80 percent of other elderly people live with the nuclear family. Meanwhile, 17.48 percent lived only with their partner. Meanwhile, the remaining 9.66 percent of the elderly live alone and have to independently meet their food, health and social needs.</p>



<p>Elderly housing are opportunities that can be looked at by developers in the country. Because although only about 8 percent, this number is equivalent to the population of Singapore and Japan.</p>



<p>In the midst of unfavorable property market conditions, there are actually many other opportunities that can be targeted by developers. One of them is housing for the elderly, and not many have developed this subsector</p>



<p>This opportunity is also in line with the government&#8217;s plan to develop 10 new Bali. And furthermore, the government only needs to add health infrastructure and if successful, of course not only Indonesians will be interested but also elderly people from abroad.</p>



<p>&#8220;Indonesia also has many urbanites who certainly rarely meet their parents, even though our parents need someone to talk to,&#8221; said an expert in the field of elderly people in Indonesia.</p>



<p>Currently, the market share for the elderly is targeting the upper middle class. However, it is also possible for the middle class or even low-income people.</p>



<p>The areas of Bandung and Bogor are potential locations for elderly nursing home developers considering their location which is not too far from Jakarta. In addition to other areas in a number of regions in Indonesia, both based on mountains and oceans, such as Bali, Malang, Yogyakarta, and other areas whose infrastructure is sufficiently good with the availability of health facilities</p>



<p>Currently, Singapore and Australia are two countries that are intensively developing special housing for the elderly.</p>



<p>Currently, countries that have taken advantage of the residential market for the elderly are Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. These neighboring countries attract the elderly to come and live there, including from Indonesia.</p>



<p>There are also quite a lot of business opportunities for companion or expansion of business opportunities from providing housing for the elderly, including providing facilities for the elderly for creative activities such as painting and handicrafts as well as a senior botanic garden for growing fruit, flowers and herbs.</p>



<p>This provided activity place can be intended for the elderly as end users or as a means for the elderly to provide or sell services to the public using the facilities provided</p>



<p>We open opportunities for those of you who are interested in this business to find financing partners, land owners or operations</p>



<p>Please contact us if you are interested in this business opportunity and have at least one of the advantages whether you have land and want to find partners, or are looking for partners who have land locations</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The whole world is on the verge of the Great Wealth Transfer]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The whole world is on the verge of the Great Wealth Transfer, with baby boomers expected to bestow trillions of dollars on younger generations in the coming years.</p>
<p>To prepare for this shift, the financial services industry is rapidly adapting to serve millennials, increasingly focusing on financial-planning solutions infused with technology and flexible fee-structures, as well as debt- and cash-management solutions and even non-financial lifestyle enhancements. But just as this is happening, another generation – Gen Z – is forcing the financial services industry to adapt yet again.</p>
<p>The money habits of millennials have widely been studied. Having come of age and entered the job market during the Great Recession, they are often considered to be more cautious and intentional with their money. Millennials prioritize saving for the future, avoiding debt, and spending on life experiences over material possessions. They also tend to be more comfortable than older generations in using technology to manage their finances.</p>
<p>Gen Z, now nearing and entering their early 20s, is forming its own set of priorities and characteristics, in some cases different — albeit in nuanced ways — from those of their millennial counterparts. Here’s what appears so far to be the most important money priorities for Gen Z, as well as the resulting trends that the financial services industry should consider as it evolves to meet the demands of this up-and-coming generation:</p>
<h4><strong>Gen Z has a more debt-centric approach to their finances</strong></h4>
<p>Having learned from the millennials’ experiences, Gen Z may be better prepared (or resigned) to handle many of the same challenges. For example, both generations have experienced a substantial increase in the costs of education, housing and personal expenses, making debt almost unavoidable. In turn, members of Gen Z are likely to be more proactive in addressing their debt, creating a real need for expert advice focused on debt management.</p>
<p>To help them make better decisions, financial advisers should be prepared to offer advice around how much and what type of debt to incur and, by the time they graduate, provide guidance as to how best to start earning income and saving for the future while strategically addressing debt.</p>
<p>To mitigate some of their debt burden, Gen Z may also be more flexible and intentional about where they go to school, with public schools and programs offering merit-based support gaining more interest among Gen Z students. Again, financial advisers have a role to play here, offering advice regarding student-debt strategies and even school selections.</p>
<h4><strong>Gen Z seeks to balance financial security with personal fulfillment in career and life choices</strong></h4>
<p>Personal fulfillment is important to Gen Z, but they don’t disregard the financial implications of different careers. That said, many members of Gen Z do prioritize the impact of their work relative to financial gain and understand the necessary financial sacrifices. Understandably, most want both and are prepared to compromise and work hard to find the right balance.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that when members of Gen Z enter college and choose a field of study, they may not necessarily see themselves as choosing a permanent career. Many have grown to accept that they will end up working with multiple employers in varying fields. They also may be more accepting of the need to take on multiple jobs to financially sustain themselves and achieve their goals. Advisers should consider this dynamic as they monitor and chart the progress of their Gen Z clients against their plans. Income levels are less likely to be predictable and consistent over the careers of Gen Z, possibly requiring frequent course corrections.</p>
<p>In any event, travel and leisure are an important part of the work-life balance Gen Z seeks and may present further financial-planning challenges. They want the time to experience new adventures and enjoy life but also must be more cost-conscious and disciplined in how they pursue these activities. Financial advisers can help members of Gen Z by providing technology-enabled advice on budgeting and saving to help them balance their financial responsibilities with their career and lifestyle goals. Advisers will need to adapt to a generation that is more pressured financially than others but still wants to leave its mark on the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Gen Z is focused on the impact of their investing</strong></h4>
<p>Gen Z tends to have a greater focus on socially responsible investing, perhaps even more so than millennials. With the internet and advances in technology, they have grown up with access to abundant and incessant information. With all this information, understanding exactly where and how their money is being invested and how their investments may impact others is important to them. They want financial gains to be balanced with having a positive impact on the world. For Gen Z, socially responsible companies may provide the balance they seek and could be the long-term winners in the future that they will one day lead.</p>
<h4><strong>Gen Z remains open to personalized financial advice</strong></h4>
<p>While Gen Z is comfortable with technology, they still remain willing to engage with professionals offering personalized financial advice versus using robo-s. As a generation, to them their challenges are bigger and more complicated than prior generations, and, as such, they may not feel well-served by algorithms — at least not yet. What they really need is education, patience, and an understanding of their specific circumstances, along with a desire to help them achieve their goals despite the many challenges they face.</p>
