Furthermore, with cities and their buildings currently accounting for 65% of global energy demand, it is evident that the buildings we construct today are crucial for the evolution of smart cities and our push towards net-zero targets.<\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row type=&#8221;in_container&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;padding-2-percent&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;small_depth&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;5px&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221;][nectar_animated_title heading_tag=&#8221;h6&#8243; style=&#8221;color-strip-reveal&#8221; color=&#8221;Accent-Color&#8221; text=&#8221;Supporting buildings of the future&#8221;][vc_column_text]\r\n<p>Intelligent buildings are a vital element to a future where cities become safe, smart and sustainable and building owners can harness and control their own energy usage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Smart building technology has already helped many thousands of buildings and homes consume energy more efficiently. ABB has supported the construction of the New Development Bank (NDB) Headquarters in Shanghai by installing an intelligent and integrated building controls system, to manage indoor lighting, electric curtains and windows that involve more than 8,000 control circuits. Following the installation, the NBD Headquarters was able to make energy savings of more than 15% compared to conventional systems.<\/p>\r\n<p>2021 marks a turning point in our collective ability to bring down emissions in our cities, save energy, and speed up the transition to renewable energy with smart buildings and power grids though the convergence of AI and IoT.<\/p>\r\n<p>As emerging technologies continue to develop, more opportunities arise for buildings to leverage new technological processes and data sources.\u00a0The concept of using technology to improve our cities and buildings is not a new one, but what\u00a0<em>is<\/em>\u00a0different is that IoT is now enabling us to connect an increasing number of devices which were not connected before. Connectivity really is the key to unleashing the true potential of intelligent buildings, unlocking opportunities for new information from infinite sources to be analyzed and combined, offering a new level of intelligence.<\/p>\r\n<p>However, it is not just about using new technologies; smart thinking and the optimisation of existing buildings is a key factor when it comes to accelerating the sustainable development of smart cities globally. ABB is working closely with cities and utilities to obtain greater efficiencies from existing infrastructure and build unified, attractive city services as part of a move towards smarter cities. With IoT technologies, older buildings can take full advantage of the data they generate and adjust to how they operate.<\/p>\r\n<p>One city doing just that is\u00a0Zaragoza, the capital of Aragon, Spain. The city sought to reduce its total energy consumption by 20% with a focus on four major Zaragoza smart city buildings: the historical Seminario of Zaragoza, which houses City Hall offices, the main City Hall, the main police station and the Technology &amp; Art Center. Advanced energy monitoring was provided through a cloud-based energy management platform to bring the four buildings into compliance with the ISO 50001 standard. As a consequence, Zaragoza was able to fulfill the first steps on its way to compliance, and the collaboration resulted in savings of up to 30% in operational costs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another great example of smart city technology in action can be found in\u00a0Hanoi, Vietnam. As part of the project, Vietnamese multinational telecommunication service, Viettel Group, is targetting to achieve their green objectives. Viettel wanted their headquarters in Hanoi to be a symbol of innovation and to set the standard for the rest of their buildings around the world. In order to meet the high demand for safe, smart and connected workplaces, a range of smart building technology has been supplied. Key to the project was the\u00a0<em>i-bus KNX system<\/em>, with all devices of the building ranging from lighting and shutter control to heating, ventilation, security and energy management communicating with one and another via a single bus interface.<\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row type=&#8221;in_container&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;padding-2-percent&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; column_element_spacing=&#8221;default&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;small_depth&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;5px&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221; border_type=&#8221;simple&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221;][nectar_animated_title heading_tag=&#8221;h6&#8243; style=&#8221;color-strip-reveal&#8221; color=&#8221;Accent-Color&#8221; text=&#8221;Turning existing infrastructure into smart buildings for smart cities&#8221;][vc_column_text]\r\n<p>So, what are the challenges when it comes to upgrading existing building infrastructure, and how can smart, IoT-based technology overcome them?<\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"nectar-fancy-ul\" data-list-icon=\"icon-salient-thin-line\" data-animation=\"false\" data-animation-delay=\"0\" data-color=\"accent-color\" data-spacing=\"default\" data-alignment=\"left\"> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Financing:<\/strong>\u00a0Upgrading a building may seem like a costly expense, however the advancements in IoT mean this is no longer the case.\u00a0 Modern sensors can be connected wirelessly, without the need for expensive installation costs.
