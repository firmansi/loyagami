Knibb Design is known for its hospitality portfolio that includes three locations of The LINE Hotel, as well as a range of commercial and residential work.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always looking at how can I make references and tell the story to multiple groups of people,\u201d Knibb explains. For Treehouse, his client \u201cgave me a lot of latitude to take individual spaces that could seem quite fragmented from each other, but the narrative throughout is community, eclecticism, and diversity, and weave that in.\u201d Knibb is also an accomplished landscape designer, an element that proved to be key given the project name and theme.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlhcrf52yy65.i.optimole.com\/cb:61wC~11f40\/w:auto\/h:auto\/q:mauto\/https:\/\/www.loyagami.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-044.jpg\" alt=\"Image 044\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The building can accommodate up to 60 residents who rent individual bedrooms within shared and furnished apartments.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Treehouse lands somewhere on the millennial-appealing spectrum between crashing with trusted friends and luxury apartment living, combined with startup culture savvy. The five-story building that\u2019s topped with a lush rooftop garden lounge accommodates up to 60 residents who rent individual bedrooms with en suite bathrooms set within shared and furnished 3- and 5-bedroom flats, and six individual studio apartments. The no-compromise part Walker describes refers to the high quality of design, materials, and soundproofing.<\/p>\n<p>While not a cooperative, given that Treehouse dwellers don\u2019t have ownership stakes, genuine cooperation and consensus are still key organizational elements. Regular meetings are scheduled with the Director of Community, and communal dinners open to all take place on Sundays. (There\u2019s a Treehouse app for much of this planning, naturally.) In keeping with Walker\u2019s community-minded activist roots, two units containing six bedrooms are designated as highly affordable for low-income tenants, and he\u2019s partnered with My Friend\u2019s Place, a nearby drop-in social services center for homeless youth.<\/p>\n<p>Within the building that\u2019s tucked into a narrow lot\u2014the last vacant one on its street\u2014Knibb adapted his hospitality design expertise to this newly evolving, hybrid residential context. \u201cThe flow and the interconnection of the common spaces make the entire building feel like it\u2019s your home,\u201d Walker observes. The lobby, for instance, contains a lounge area and a pour-over coffee bar, which Knibb encouraged based on rituals and interactions he\u2019s observed at Flowerboy, the flower shop and cafe that he co-owns next to his studio in Venice.<\/p>\n<div>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlhcrf52yy65.i.optimole.com\/cb:61wC~11f40\/w:auto\/h:auto\/q:mauto\/https:\/\/www.loyagami.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-054.jpg\" alt=\"Image 054\" \/><\/div>\n<p>The shared kitchen and dining hall serves as a place to get to know other residents, hang out, or work.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>\u201cPeople can bump into each other casually and hang out, or work,\u201d the designer says. The stairwell leading to the basement is lined with backpacks to incorporate \u201csubtle cues that this is your home, this is where you leave things and decompress.\u201d At the lower level, Treehouse\u2019s white-walled laundry facility is spacious enough to work as an art and photography studio, a small workout space, or however else residents see fit.<\/p>\n<p>Knibb devised all the utilitarian and social areas to support \u201cmultiple tasks in what would normally be a singular experience space.\u201d The library has a mezzanine for working perched above cozy reading nooks and ample shelves. The shared kitchen\/dining hall is flooded with natural light and offers sweeping views towards downtown L.A., making it an extremely pleasant spot to work in during the day.<\/p>\n<p>In each unit, bedrooms come furnished with platform beds Knibb custom designed to efficiently integrate seating and storage. Every bedroom closet curtain is different, and bathroom tile patterns vary. Kitchens feature whimsical plastic chandeliers Knibb devised and marble and quartz countertops each assembled from multiple slabs. Walker and Knibb also ensured that kitchens are stocked with the basics along with a visually pleasing array of tableware and culinary tools, about which Knibb is particularly passionate.<\/p>\n<div><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/mlhcrf52yy65.i.optimole.com\/cb:61wC~11f40\/w:auto\/h:auto\/q:mauto\/https:\/\/www.loyagami.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-065.jpg\" alt=\"Image 065\" \/><\/div>\n<p>\u201cYou might never cook, but the idea that you have a kitchen with chopsticks, wine glasses, different types of bowls\u201d brings the world into each unit. \u201cAfrican bowls, Mexican bowls carved in Oaxaca, bamboo from Vietnam, bowls from China, the Rose Bowl,\u201d Knibb jokes when pointing to a vintage object procured at the famed Pasadena flea market.<\/p>\n<p>Up on the roof, Knibb is eager to see the planter boxes newly populated with lavender, meadow grasses, Santa Barbara daisies, geraniums, and herbs, plus the coral, maple and ginkgo trees reach a lush and wild state. Residents can use the outdoor cooking amenities and gather around the large outdoor TV. Knibb nods towards the flashy corporate headquarters of a certain streaming service on Sunset Boulevard that towers over Treehouse. \u201cI\u2019m watching Netflix\u2014and watching Netflix.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cCommunity without compromise\u201d is Treehouse Co-living\u2018s co-founder Prophet Walker\u2019s response when asked what distinguishes the \u201cco-living\u201d model from a conventional apartment building.
