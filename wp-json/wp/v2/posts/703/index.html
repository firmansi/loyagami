The concept was simple: If you have something lying idle, list it, and people will rent it out. By 2016, nearly 300 million people were participating in the sharing economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The sharing economy banks on the concept of collective use of community resources and technology to shape business models, and startups are riding the wave of collaborative consumption. Many startups are leveraging the concept of sharing or renting and running their operations successfully. Modern technology decreases operating services expenses and anticipates customer requirements. There are multiple global companies operating under this model, helping millions of people rent rooms, lease offices, get business loans, and share houses, cars, bicycles, clothes, skills, and so on. They have a typical rating or review system, so that people on both sides of the transaction can trust each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Additionally, products and services are offered at affordable costs with no long-term commitments. These qualities instantly resonate with millennials. As a result, companies such as Gojek\/Grab and Airbnb are dominating their respective spaces. Cars, homes, furniture and office spaces are now used on a time-limited per-use basis rather than requiring the expense and burden of ownership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The sharing economy also brings a new phenomenon: Coworking spaces. Shared workspaces pose as the perfect example of the shared economy in two ways: First, by providing access to shared physical assets like an office infrastructure, and second, by sharing of intangible assets like collaboration and mentorship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Coworking spaces make it seamless for companies and young entrepreneurs to resist long leases of commercial office spaces. They provide many of the amenities of traditional offices but place a much greater emphasis on community building and experience for members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The inherently flexible and collaborative nature of coworking spaces has garnered immense success from its large base of clientele, ranging from not only small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startups but also large corporations, multinational companies and freelancers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The sharing economy\u2019s growth has dazed everyone. It is a trend that is here to stay, as it is a perfect balance of cost-saving and better infrastructure that benefits both parties in the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">By creating your company own co-working space, you not only provide a work environment for your employees, but your company be able to create your own community where you company can quickly test the markets  for products or services that you company create, and in addition, this strategy can ease the burden of your operational costs rather than renting an office just for your own company<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">However, owning property assets can be a fairly strong bargaining position in the eyes of investors and banks for any business you run<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some of you might notice that one of Loyagami solution is to help businesses create their own co working place eventhough they might not be in real estate or co&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":34,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[179,22],"tags":[],"wf_post_folders":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/703"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=703"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/703\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/34"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=703"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=703"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=703"},{"taxonomy":"wf_post_folders","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/wf_post_folders?post=703"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
