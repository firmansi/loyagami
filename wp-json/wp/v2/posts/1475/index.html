Modern Retail and Glossy reporters took a (virtual) trip around the globe to see where shopping is beginning to restart and if shoppers are ready to spend money once again in the real world.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><b>Brazil: An uphill battle<\/b><br \/>\nDespite intensified cries for the Brazilian economy to reopen, the country remains one of the most afflicted by coronavirus.<\/p>\n<p>As of Friday, May 29 there have been 441,000 cases in Brazil, behind the U.S\u2019s 1.76 million cases. But the daily death toll has leapfrogged past the states; more than 26,000 residents have died as of May 29. Initially Brazil\u2019s response to coronavirus in mid-March was assertive, with cruises canceled and arriving travelers urged to go into quarantine. But since then, Brazil has lost two health ministers \u2014 one fired, the other resigned \u2014 and has at times struggled to lock down at all. President Jair Bolsonaro has ordered the economy to reopen, but many local and statewide governments have defied these instructions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Bolsonaro said when asked by reporters in late April about Brazil\u2019s mounting fatalities. \u201cI mourn [the deaths]. What do you want me to do?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At the end of April, 10% of the country\u2019s malls had reopened according to Bloomberg. BR Malls, Brazil\u2019s largest mall operator, had reopened four out of its 29 Brazilian locations as of May 22, according to a company spokesperson. Drinking fountains were deactivated while all food retailers must use disposable plates, cups and silverware. BR Malls imported 104 cameras with infrared sensors from China in order to measure the body temperature of shoppers, and all 29 Brazilian locations will receive at least three cameras.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe cameras will reinforce the screening work carried out at the entrance to shopping malls,\u201d said a company spokesperson. \u201cCurrently, all customer tenants and employees have their temperature checked with manual thermometers before accessing shopping centers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stores within malls are adopting their own systems. Natura &amp; Co., which owns Aesop, The Body Shop, and social-selling companies Natura Cosm\u00e9ticos and Avon Inc., has tested drive-through and curbside pick-up in 30 shopping malls within Brazil.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe process of reopening will occur gradually, accompanied by rigorous hygiene measures to safeguard the health of customers and co-workers, in compliance with local regulations,\u201d said Paula Andrade, Natura &amp; Co vp of retail for Latin America<\/p>\n<p>Natura has also added beauty consultations via WhatsApp to all brands, added Andrade. According to Natura &amp; Co., first-quarter earnings from May 7, The Body Shop and Aesop have experienced a 300% and 500% increase in e-commerce sales since approximately March, while Natura\u2019s and Avon\u2019s e-commerce sales combined have grown by 150%.<\/p>\n<p>E-commerce penetration nationwide has naturally grown during this period, with digital sales increasing by 30% between mid-March and the end of April, according to Brazilian e-commerce association ABComm. However, this could slow as unemployment mounts and consumer confidence erodes due to the political crisis and growing death rate. The International Monetary Fund predicts Brazil\u2019s economy will contract by 5.3% in 2020, while unemployment is expected to reach at least 17%. <i>\u2013Emma Sandler<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Italy: Hit hard and forced to modernize<br \/>\n<\/b>Italy, in addition to being a major economy, is also home to some of the biggest brands in fashion and luxury, including Gucci, Versace and Bottega Veneta. It was also one of the hardest hit by coronavirus and an early arbiter of what was to come for much of the rest of Europe and the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Consequently, Italy\u2019s retail market has suffered, with retail sales down as much as 40% in some cases. The national lockdown lasted for 67 days, with stores beginning to reopen on May 18. But only about a third of Italy\u2019s stores reopened, and those that did were left with huge stockpiles of unsold inventory and no tourism to support sales. Italy relies heavily on tourism, which can\u2019t open back up until June 3<\/p>\n<p>Italy has begun offering inflation-linked retail bonds to investors as a way to jumpstart its suffering economy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBased on what I heard from a lot of the brands I work with in Italy, things were not good,\u201d said Christina Fontana, Alibaba\u2019s director of fashion and luxury for Europe, who is based in Milan. \u201cEven e-commerce wasn\u2019t happening at first because the logistics centers were all closed, though e-commerce is back up now. Gucci stopped doing deliveries, Yoox stopped doing deliveries. A lot of stores closed that won\u2019t ever open back up again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The one upside to all this is that e-commerce across Italy \u2014 a country notorious for being slow on the uptake of online shopping \u2014 is up. According to McKinsey, e-commerce transactions in Italy rose by 81% from February to the end of April. Italian brands like Diesel and Bulgari have launched e-commerce platforms for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cItaly had one of the lowest e-commerce penetrations in Europe,\u201d Fontana said. \u201cEven in smaller towns, not the big cities, there are high-end shops and people never really shopped online. That\u2019s changing. I think Italy\u2019s going to modernize very fast now.\u201d \u2013<i>Danny Parisi<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Australia: Economic ebbs and flow<\/b><b><br \/>\n<\/b>With a low number of cases and abundant testing, Australia\u2019s economy closed late and returned early. To date, the country has had 7,173 cases, with 6,582 recovered and 103 deaths, among the population of 25 million. Despite a lack of government orders restricting retailers\u2019 operations until well into April, many of the country\u2019s brick and mortar shops chose to close their doors as a safety precaution. The country\u2019s retail scene began to open as early as May 4, with high touch facilities like barbershops and nail salons expected to resume services by early June.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the general lack of foot traffic due to Australians staying indoors this spring has hurt the bottom line for many businesses, especially those that failed to adapt quickly. Overall, retail sales were generally down during closures, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 May report, which estimated them to have fallen a record 17.9% in April after a 8.5% spike in March. The same period also saw the nation\u2019s unemployment rate increase a record one-month jump, from 5.2% to 6.2%.<\/p>\n<p>Department store Target \u2014 not to be confused with the nearly-identical American chain \u2014 has been one of the hardest hit during the pandemic. Like many department stores, the already-struggling company had been losing ground to e-commerce and younger brands, and the coronavirus only made things worse. At the end of April, Target announced the shutting of 75 of its 284 locations and converting 95 into Kmarts, which is also owned by parent company Wesfarmers. \u201cGiven the high degree of fixed occupancy costs, a sustained decline in sales momentum will have a material impact on the profitability of Kmart and Target,\u201d Wesfarmers said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there have been some digital bright spots. As one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets, sellers did benefit from Australian consumers\u2019 high rate adoption of digital shopping, including the use of installment payment services. These include, Sezzle and Melbourne-based Afterpay, which have seen even more growth during this period. In particular, Afterpay said it has seen an increase in sales across several categories, which the company attributed to Australian customers\u2019 \u201cdesire to refresh their home office and environment\u201d during shelter-in-place.<\/p>\n<p>Other Australian retailers have turned to their own apps to gin up business. Fashion retailer the Cotton On Group temporarily closed brick-and-mortar stores in late March. It increased sales, however, with its new app, according to the company. Since rolling out the iOS version in New Zealand, Australia and the U.S. at the end of 2019, the brand experienced \u201ca significant increase\u201d in customer engagement across stores, its website and the app.<\/p>\n<p>The early shift of focus to digital also helped increase signups of the retailer\u2019s loyalty program, Cotton On &amp; Co. Perks, which surpassed 8 million active members worldwide. <i>\u2013Gabriela Barkho<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Sweden: A voluntary shift to online<br \/>\n<\/b>Despite the Swedish government\u2019s widely reported soft approach to fighting the pandemic \u2014 restricting large gatherings, but keeping schools, stores and restaurants open \u2014 locals\u2019 shopping behavior has largely aligned with that of Americans. Likewise, efforts by Swedish retailers to ease the minds of in-store shoppers and establish improved e-commerce experiences haven\u2019t been that unique.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSweden didn\u2019t shut down, but Swedes changed their behavior, becoming less social,\u201d said Andreas Palm, CEO of Stockholm-based men\u2019s underwear brand CDLP. \u201cIt was voluntary social distancing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Swedish health officials issued first warnings around the virus on March 11, which drove apparel sales down 57% for the remainder of the month. Total apparel sales, including e-commerce, fell by 39% in March year-over-year. Retail sales across the board saw its first drop since December 2018 in April.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Palm said, the summer weather has people out and about, but they\u2019re still not going into stores. CDLP\u2019s sole retail store, in Stockholm\u2019s highly trafficked Stureplan public square, only shut down for two days in March. It now permits three shoppers at a time, but traffic has remained \u201cvery slow,\u201d he said. His regular customers have moved to shopping online.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t see retail as an option the same way they did before,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Caroline Blumenthal, partner at Stockholm-based PR agency Patriksson Group, said local retailers are taking many safety precautions. They\u2019re putting up signs and marking floors leading to checkouts, urging shoppers to stay two meters apart. They\u2019re also limiting shoppers in-store, shortening business hours and days (from seven to five), keeping fitting rooms closed and increasing cleanings. Stockholm-based H&amp;M has removed all testing products in their beauty departments and is restricting cash purchases, she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI personally feel comfortable shopping now,\u201d said Blumenthal. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t wear a mask, just like the vast majority.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Blumenthal said that, in malls, some global brands have temporarily closed stores based on recommendations from other countries, and overall, malls are seeing \u201ca great lack of visitors.\u201d Palm said CDLP\u2019s largest wholesale account, Swedish department store NK, is seeing \u201czero foot traffic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Palm said he has yet to see a lot of store vacancies, as \u201cevery brand knows a retailer.\u201d Instead, there\u2019s been a lot of real estate shuffling: Brands that took prime street-level space are moving to second floors to save money<b>.<\/b> Other brands are seeing opportunities to grow by expanding to two floors, or they\u2019re moving their offices to a level that was once retail. His store\u2019s landlord is allowing him to pay 50% of the usual rent.<\/p>\n<p>Palm said he\u2019s debating whether to keep his store, which he had opened when it became too costly to acquire customers online. To attract customers, he said the store will have to offer more of an experience \u2014 though the comeback of experiential retail, at this point, seems far-fetched.<\/p>\n<p>As shoppers move online, retailers are offering more services, including increased delivery options, said Blumenthal. Many fashion and beauty brands, like skin-care brand SkinTreat and beauty chain Kicks, are also providing live shopping opportunities through local video tech company Bambuser.\u00a0 <i>\u2013Jill Manoff<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>South Korea: Too soon for optimism<br \/>\n<\/b>Praised as an exemplary model for flattening the Covid-19 curve \u2014 and without a full lockdown, no less \u2014 South Korea is not out of the woods yet.<\/p>\n<p>South Korea began reopening on May 6, but is reimplementing new closings due to a spike in new cases. The country\u2019s health minister, Park Neung-hoo, announced on May 28 that museums, parks and art galleries will be closed again for two weeks beginning May 29, and is discouraging residents from going to restaurants or gathering in groups. Newly reopened schools have been closed again, while others have delayed reopening altogether. The country has also closed bars and nightclubs after a new spike in cases traced to nightlife.<\/p>\n<p>As the world\u2019s largest travel retail market, South Korean retail was hit especially hard by a lack of international visitors that began back when the coronavirus hit China earlier this year. South Korea\u2019s largest beauty conglomerate Amorepacific reported a more than 19% decline in revenue in its home market for the first quarter, citing a loss of travel-related spending and decreased operation hours at beauty counters within travel retail shops and department stores.<\/p>\n<p>Travel retail spending is \u201cgone right now,\u201d said Dino Ha, the founder and CEO of K-beauty company Memebox. \u201cEven for us, there is at least a 50% drop [in sales from travel retail locations in South Korea]. Local retail is also down right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are signs of an emerging bounceback for overall retail sales; sales grew by 3.9% year-over-year in April among the country\u2019s 26 largest online and offline retailers, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Burberry also recently reported that its sales in South Korea were bouncing back.<\/p>\n<p>Though stores were not forced to close, store sales among the country\u2019s 13 largest retailers declined by 5.5% in April, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. Still, some growth has occurred since residents are shopping online; the country reported 16.9% e-commerce growth in April.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile South Korea did not enforce a full lockdown, many people still chose to participate in social distancing and stay-at-home for safety. Korea also saw shopping patterns switch significantly from offline to online, and our Korea Q1 online sales were up 80%,\u201d said an Amorepacific spokesperson.<\/p>\n<p>Online fashion and beauty shopping trends have mirrored those in other countries, with casualwear and skin care trending. On e-commerce platform Gmarket, sales of loungewear increased by 133%, leggings grew 46% and women\u2019s sports pants were up 365% in April year-over-year. In beauty, lipstick sales plunged 45% and blush was down 11%, but face serum saw a 117% increase. Toner, cleanser and eyeliner, meanwhile, also had strong sales growth.<\/p>\n<p>Livestream shopping has been helpful in the region, especially via Instagram. Department store chains including Lotte, Shinsegae, and AK Plaza have been investing in livestreaming to capture some of the online boom. But, like in the U.S., these chains are feeling the pain of lost physical retail, with a 14.8% decline in April, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. South Korea\u2019s largest department store chain Lotte will sell 121 of its physical locations this year due to the net loss of $35 million that it experienced in the first quarter.<\/p>\n<p>Pre-coronavirus, South Korea also had a strong offline retail scene, with fashion and beauty retailers investing heavily in in-store experiences.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere have been so many interesting and disruptive retail concepts,\u201d said Peach &amp; Lily founder and CEO Alicia Yoon, who noted that a growing number of brands have been working to one-up each other with high-tech, experiential flagships that felt like a retail \u201cDisneyland.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the change in consumer behavior, brands might begin to rethink these concepts for the long term.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe country has not shut down, so people are definitely still going into stores and shopping, but I would say that there\u2019s still a pretty marked difference,\u201d said Yoon. \u201cPeople are still trying not to go in places if they don\u2019t really have to.\u201d <i>\u2013Liz Flora\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Germany: Shoppers aren\u2019t rushing back to stores<br \/>\n<\/b>Germany was one of the first Western European countries to allow its retail stores to reopen, after shutting down in mid-March. First, the country allowed stores under 8,600 square feet to reopen in late April, provided they followed cleaning and social distancing rules. Then, at the beginning of May, all shops were allowed to reopen. To date, Germany, whose population exceeds 83 million, has had 80,400 coronavirus cases \u2014 roughly a third of the number of cases reported by hard-hit Italy and Spain.<\/p>\n<p>But, as the trajectory of Germany has proven, getting all stores to reopen doesn\u2019t mean that shoppers will come rushing back. A survey of more than 600 non-food retailers, conducted in mid-May by Handelsverband Deutschland, a German retail trade association, found that about a third are doing at most 50% the same amount of sales that they were doing last year. As such, the organization is calling for more economic assistance for retailers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFoot traffic has remained considerably lower compared to before the pandemic,\u201d said Maxim Hofer, a research analyst at Euromonitor International based in D\u00fcsseldorf. \u201cI think that\u2019s mostly because of the measures that are still in place in terms of hygiene and distancing, but also because of economic uncertainty.\u201d Each of Germany\u2019s 16 states has set different rules about where exactly people are required to wear face masks in public, as well as what the fines are for people who don\u2019t follow the rules.<\/p>\n<p>Getting retail traffic back to normal also depends on getting more than just German shoppers in the door. \u201cOur city locations are seeing a reduced number of tourists and an increase of local customers,\u201d\u00a0 Fouad Goss, general manager of retail Europe at Puma, said in an email. Goss said that Puma has seen an increased demand in running and training products, similar to what athletic apparel retailers are seeing other countries as there\u2019s more interest for working out at home and indoors.<\/p>\n<p>But retailers are starting to be able to move forward with expansion plans that had been in place before the pandemic. In the beginning of May, Puma reopened its brand store near its headquarters in Herzogenaurach that had undergone a redesign during which the sales floor was doubled. Its reopening had been delayed several weeks because of the coronavirus.<i> \u2013Anna Hensel\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>India: The worst is yet to come<br \/>\n<\/b>With 1.3 billion residents, the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on India can be massive.<\/p>\n<p>The large population \u2014 which ranks second to China \u2014 combined with its smaller geographic region (it is the seventh-largest country by area) makes it difficult for Indians to socially distance. Despite Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi instituting one of the strictest lockdowns globally on March 24, India had more than 169,000 cases of the virus, as of Friday, May 29, because government officials have loosened rules. Beyond cases in major cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Ahmedabad, migrant workers in villages across northern India are becoming infected at an increasingly alarming rate.<\/p>\n<p>Like the U.S., the country is worried about the economic implications of Covid-19. India has seen its GDP slow to about 3.1% for the fourth quarter (January to March), according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. This brings the yearly GDP down to 4.2 percent, an 11-year low.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously the hit on retail has been significant. According to National Payments Corporation of India, overall retail payment volume (or payment tractions) declined by 21% in April compared to February, and overall retail sales declined by 57% in March compared to the month prior.<\/p>\n<p>Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester India said, \u201cWe expect consumers to clearly differentiate between essentials, like grocery, personal hygiene and home cleaning, versus non-essential spending, like phones, electronics and fashion appliances.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meena is using China, which saw a 21% decline in retail sales between January and February, and only 3% growth in e-commerce sales, as a marker for India\u2019s future. \u201cThe reason for [their] growth was driven by online grocery. We expect this to play out in India differently, as less than 10% of the Indian online retail market is made up of grocery and personal care products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The beauty and fashion segments have been hit especially hard, as beauty and fashion stores are found in malls in larger cities, said Vishnu Vardhan, Euromonitor International consultant.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA big chunk of beauty and fashion stores are present in tier one cities (larger cities like Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad), which have a high number of Covid[-19] cases and are classified as red zones. With home seclusion becoming an integral part of consumers\u2019 lives, sales of beauty and fashion categories are getting impacted at least in the short term,\u201d said Vardhan.<\/p>\n<p>Online shopping platform Nykaa has re-opened eight physical retail stores in Goa, Jaipur, New Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai, and is following the same procedures in stores that it is following in its warehouses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe immediately implemented stringent hygiene practices in our warehouses and with delivery partners, as the safety of our employees and customers is our highest priority. Since the revised guidelines, we have opened contactless delivery of our entire beauty catalog to approved pin codes [what the country calls its postal index numbers] across India,\u201d said a company spokesperson. \u201cOur standalone retail stores have also resumed operations. Here, we have a detailed sanitation SOP [standard operating procedure], which includes daily fumigation of the stores, masks for all employees, temperature checks and frequent hand hygiene.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The lack of stores has resulted in significant pent-up demand, according to Nykaa, which saw its personal grooming and self-care category see a 3.5X increase in sales compared to pre-coronavirus figures. Interest and sales of hair masks and hair color have also grown for the company. This is a result of the DIY beauty effect, said Pradeep Srinivasan, Euromonitor International consultant, as homes, not salons or stores, have become \u201cwellness hubs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While lip products are a hallmark of Indian beauty, a spokesperson for Nykaa said eyeshadow sales increased, due to the use of masks, and is one of the top-three selling categories for the platform.<\/p>\n<p>But not all beauty and personal care brands have the digital prowess to respond to growing online sales, said Ninad Shah, founder of event company Brothers Incorporated, which puts on the India Make Up Show. This is especially true of smaller indie brands.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany homegrown beauty brands, even though they are popular, are not even on e-commerce because they aren\u2019t built with massive funding or inventory capabilities, but with passion,\u201d said Shah. \u201cThey weren\u2019t in a rush, but now they realize they have to build capabilities or rely on Amazon or Facebook Shops, because it was the salons, spas or stores that had the traffic.\u201d <i>\u2013Priya Rao<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>The United Kingdom: A slow response leading to a prolonged shutdown<br \/>\n<\/b>The U.K. was one of the slowest European countries to take drastic measures in response to the coronavirus. It first locked down on March 24, more than a week after other neighboring countries like Germany, France and Spain. This was due to what experts would describe later as critical missteps; the country didn\u2019t get adequate supplies into the country to deal with the virus\u2019s spread, waited to announce a formal shutdown and tested fewer people initially compared to European counterparts. Currently, the country has over 270,000 confirmed cases (the most in Europe to date) and over 38,000 deaths.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, retail sales have fallen dramatically. The Office of National Statistics reported that the U.K.\u2019s total number of goods sold dropped by over 18% in April. While e-commerce saw a big boost \u2014 over 30% of retail sales were online that month \u2014 many industries saw total collapse. The clothing store Primark, for example, said its sales dropped to nothing after reporting \u00a3650m the month prior.<\/p>\n<p>While e-commerce did see large growth, it was already a heavily penetrated channel in the country. \u201cThe U.K. is much more advanced in e-commerce,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. Compared to the U.S., he went on, \u201cit\u2019s a much more penetrated market and much more sophisticated.\u201d In 2019, about 16.2% of total sales in the country were done online, according to GlobalData.<\/p>\n<p>The big retailers, however, lead the pack in terms of online programs. Supermarket giants like Tesco and Sainsbury saw sales grow in the double-digit percents last month. In response to the shutdown, they both announced expanded home delivery programs as well as buy online, pick-up in-store capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t leave out the entire possibility of competition from upstarts. Some smaller digitally native brands have also seen a huge uptick in sales. U.K.-based Ugly Drinks, for example, saw DTC sales grow 500% in the U.K. since March. Of course, this was offset with the fact that many of its retail channels were completely shut off. According to co-founder and CEO Hugh Thomas, other countries like the U.S. are more used to buying from smaller brands directly, so the last few months have presented a new opportunity to reach customers. \u201cWe almost see this more as a discovery phase for British consumers,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the U.K. will officially begin to reopen, but for many retailers the damage is already done. While most bigger companies have built out robust online channels, demand remains down the tubes. \u201cRetail sales have plummeted enormously for discretionary products,\u201d said Saunders.<i> \u2013Cale Guthrie Weissman<\/i><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Global retail markets are beginning to reopen after pandemic<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":531,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[179,22],"tags":[],"wf_post_folders":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1475"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1475"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1475\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/531"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1475"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1475"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1475"},{"taxonomy":"wf_post_folders","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/wf_post_folders?post=1475"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
