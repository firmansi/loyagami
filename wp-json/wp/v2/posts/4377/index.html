Bunga described herself as part of the \u201csandwich generation\u201d who became the backbone of her family \u2013 at least five people depend on her. Neither of her parents have retirement funds, so Bunga needs to take care of them. Her younger sister also has a 6-year-old daughter who is about to enter elementary school. They all live in Bunga\u2019s mother\u2019s house.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cMy salary is divided between the six of us [\u2026] so what I\u2019m doing right now is focusing on the current needs and the education of the kids,\u201d said Bunga, who also has a small business selling lemonade. Bunga recently separated from her husband and did not receive alimony \u2013 a situation that further exacerbated any plans to purchase her own house.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Bunga, even saving money for a down payment to buy either a house or an apartment is difficult \u2013 especially if the property in question is in Jakarta. In 2019, the World Bank published a report that cited evidence suggesting that house price-to-income ratios in Jakarta were higher than in New York.<\/p>\r\n<p>The report quoted calculations made by Statistics Indonesia (BPS) that showed Jakarta\u2019s house price-to-income ratio to be 10.3, while those of Denpasar, Bali and Bandung, West Java were 12.1 and 11.9 respectively. Data from Demographia and Nomura showed that those numbers were double the house price-to-income ratios in New York and Singapore.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201c[But] if I buy a [cheaper] house outside Jakarta, it will cost me more in the future \u2013 from transportation to my parents\u2019 needs,\u201d she said. \u201cSo purchasing a house can wait until later. Right now, the most important thing is daily needs, having life insurance and saving up for the kids\u2019 education,\u201d said Bunga, adding that she could rely on her office for health insurance. Bunga said she viewed other Indonesians who were not part of the \u201csandwich generation\u201d as luckier because they could just focus on themselves or perhaps their children.<\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row type=&#8221;in_container&#8221; full_screen_row_position=&#8221;middle&#8221; column_margin=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_tablet=&#8221;default&#8221; column_direction_phone=&#8221;default&#8221; scene_position=&#8221;center&#8221; text_color=&#8221;dark&#8221; text_align=&#8221;left&#8221; row_border_radius=&#8221;none&#8221; row_border_radius_applies=&#8221;bg&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; shape_divider_position=&#8221;bottom&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221;][vc_column column_padding=&#8221;padding-2-percent&#8221; column_padding_tablet=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_phone=&#8221;inherit&#8221; column_padding_position=&#8221;all&#8221; background_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; background_hover_color_opacity=&#8221;1&#8243; column_shadow=&#8221;small_depth&#8221; column_border_radius=&#8221;5px&#8221; column_link_target=&#8221;_self&#8221; gradient_direction=&#8221;left_to_right&#8221; overlay_strength=&#8221;0.3&#8243; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; tablet_width_inherit=&#8221;default&#8221; tablet_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; phone_text_alignment=&#8221;default&#8221; column_border_width=&#8221;none&#8221; bg_image_animation=&#8221;none&#8221;][vc_column_text]\r\n<p>Ria, 29, who lives in Yogyakarta, is single with no children and probably not part of the \u201csandwich generation\u201d that Bunga mentioned.
