There continues to be a strong logistics theme driven by increasing occupier demand, led by e-commerce and structural under-supply in gateway cities.<\/p>\n<h3>Alternatives Shine<\/h3>\n<p>While real estate investment in Asia Pacific took its most sudden drop in a decade during the first quarter, some investors are already indicating that they will boost allocations to the sector as equities markets continue to gyrate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of investors were burned in the public markets this year,\u201d Yuan pointed out, indicating that the stock market disruption has made major players look more closely at alternative asset classes. \u201cAn active sovereign fund reportedly spent more than $1 billion to acquire an office complex in Beijing in February, alongside signing a data centre deal in Japan and committing to a logistics venture in New Zealand.\u201d She pointed to this group as among the investors likely to stay active in the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs equities look riskier, sovereign wealth funds are upping their allocations to real estate,\u201d Yuan said. She added that, with banks becoming more cautious about lending, insurers are also seeing more opportunities as less cash-rich investors struggle to access capital.<\/p>\n<p>The multi-family sector in Japan has continued to shine even under this unpredictable environment. The sector has maintained stable income generation despite previous downturn trends following the GFC and the Great East Japan Earthquake, and still commands strong interest from global investors.<\/p>\n<p>CBRE\u2019s Capital Markets team in Japan, led by Takashi Tsuji, recently closed a large residential portfolio deal valued at USD2.75 billion with a US-based global fund player, which demonstrates the strength of the multi-family sector.<\/p>\n<h3>Tracking a Shifting Market<\/h3>\n<p>While activity recovers, CBRE\u2019s team cautions that investors making decisions in 2020 will be facing an environment that in some areas will look starkly different from a year ago and timely information will be both harder to get, and more critically important, than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn 2020, we are likely to see core assets, such as prime office and logistics properties reach the market, that would not have become available last year,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cInvestors will gravitate to well-located core assets due to the inherent strong creditworthiness and resilience of underlying cash flows. That said, increasing questions are being asked about how office and logistics spaces will be consumed by corporations, and what the long-term impact of new emerging trends may have on demand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>CBRE is the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate company with more than 530 offices and 100,000 employees worldwide. &nbsp;The company\u2019s researchers are constantly gathering and analysing data on occupier behaviour with Hyland seeing week to week changes that, this year, can show a greater shift than typically happens across a year in some markets.<\/p>\n<p>During 2020 the company\u2019s supply chain teams are working with occupiers to assess how resetting of stock levels to accommodate future supply shock risks and increased e-commerce demand will impact logistic footprints. At the same time, CBRE is working with office investors to reconcile the potential for increase in work space ratios to allow for social distancing with greater adoption of flexible work arrangements.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThings are happening very quickly. I\u2019m on Zoom calls daily with our teams around the region to try to ensure our advice is in line with changing market conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be confident that we have a picture of how assets will be looked at over the long term and how this will impact value. As a global company, we have a good pulse of the market and we are connected to key investors across Asia Pacific. \u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Working in Real Time<\/h3>\n<p>Among asset owners, Hyland has seen increasing demand for information on the market outlook and how other players are navigating the crisis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the requirements that has jumped to the forefront this year is access to real time data,\u201d he said. \u201cAsset operators want to see how their peers are dealing with issues such as rental relief, and potential sellers need up to date information on the valuation that their property can achieve of its potential on the market today.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hyland and Yuan both emphasised the need for investors and asset owners to stay informed, so as to be ready to make key decisions as markets change and critical moments arise.<\/p>\n<p>Hyland adds, \u201cWhile there are day to day challenges during this period, market information is crucial as this crisis is likely to present opportunities to the best prepared investors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><i>This sponsored feature is contributed by CBRE.<\/i><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Commercial real estate investment in Asia Pacific fell by 23 percent during the first quarter of this year<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1489,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[179,22],"tags":[],"wf_post_folders":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1484"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1484"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1484\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1489"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1484"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1484"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1484"},{"taxonomy":"wf_post_folders","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.dock.loyagami.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/wf_post_folders?post=1484"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
