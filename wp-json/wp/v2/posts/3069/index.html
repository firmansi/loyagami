These same people try to paint the new work world order black and white, saying the office of the future is a choice between work from home versus work from the office, activity-based working versus traditional workstations, or flexible versus long-term leases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any complicated decision, the choice is rarely binary. The reality is the workplace of the future is that it will be a combination of all of these things.\u202fNo matter what the office of the future looks and feels like there is still one metric that is important above all others: productivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People dismiss the idea of productivity as an important KPI for office space. They usually say that productivity is too hard to \u201cmeasure.\u201d Productivity is often looked at as an intangible, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t understand its impact in a meaningful, quantitative way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s create a formula to understand our framework. If the outcome we are aiming for is productivity, then what we really want to do is increase output. Let\u2019s define output in this case as creativity by revenue. Obviously, output isn\u2019t everything. If output goes up but it takes longer to produce it, you have not changed productivity. So what we are really talking about is efficiency which is, at its most basic level, is cost over time. That means that (CxR)x (C\/T)=P. Or, to simplify productivity equals output times efficiency, P=Output x Effieciency<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the landlords can find ways to optimize this equation in a verifiable way then both tenants and LPs will seek these landlords out above all others. The low hanging fruit for landlords to help increase efficiency is by automating mundane tasks associated with interacting with the workplace. This can include room or desk booking, access control, and billing. It might seem that shortening these often uncomplicated tasks wouldn\u2019t move the needle but remember that if you multiply this every day for every employee it really does help boost efficiency in a meaningful way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Output can be increased by an office as well. By enabling collaboration, engagement, wellness, and support, offices can boost both the creativity and the revenue associated with output. Data that offices collect can help companies better use their resources and make a palpable impact on output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the pandemic has clearly accelerated people\u2019s push for remote work, the overwhelming consensus seems to be that companies and workplaces will resort to a hybrid model of in-person and remote work. The driver for this hybrid model for organizations will be\u202fwhat creates the most productive output for my organization and what tools do I have to engage my workforce to reach this outcome?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question for landlords is whether this switch in the way we work is an opportunity or a threat. The change was already underway when many co working providers proved the need for flexibility around commercial leasing. And even though some of co working providers execution was poor, that need is still alive and well, albeit sheltering at home for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to remember that landlords now have the opportunity to move from selling \u201cfour walls,\u201d which will almost certainly be in less demand, to selling productivity. The demand for productivity is robust, inelastic and recession proof. By switching their thinking about what they are actually selling, landlords will be able to capitalize on the community that they have built, provide an unlimited amount of related services for their customers and ultimately create networks that enable the occupants of that built environment the flexibility that they have become accustomed to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The built environment is still a cornerstone of productivity for many organizations. The need to collaborate, the ability to onboard and train new employees, the creation of company culture, and the vicarious interactions that create so many productive outputs will always be a critical foundation for any organization. Productivity tools are the glue that binds organizations. To put it differently, the workspace is the \u201cSun\u201d which the workplace \u201csystem\u201d revolves around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, we are taking a broad view of what a workplace is. It includes office space, plus frictionless, self service flexible work options, remote productivity tools, network access, perks, amenities, health and wellness and an array of data to compliment all of this.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The workplace has been evolving quickly over the last few years, with everyone trying to convince the world they know what the new way of working will look like.
